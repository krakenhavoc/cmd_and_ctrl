// Package effects is the S14 card-effect catalog: declarative Forge-
// style specifications for the ~30 starter Commander cards that
// resolve automatically on the stack. Entries are keyed by Scryfall
// ID, registered at package init() time in one-file-per-card under
// this directory.
//
// Design pillars (pinned in docs/decisions/0010-card-effect-catalog.md):
//   - Declarative DSL in Go structs, no oracle-text parsing.
//   - Opt-in per Scryfall ID — non-catalog cards keep today's manual
//     sandbox posture.
//   - Effects run under the resolution write lock; primitives call
//     *Locked helpers on game.Game only. A primitive that calls a
//     public locking mutator deadlocks — enforce via review, Go can't
//     encode "locked context" at the type level.
//   - Events emitted per primitive application (see game.EmitEvent).
//
// This file declares the Spec type. Registry, Context, and primitive
// types live in neighbouring files.

	// (the earliest, most visible failure mode).

	// OnResolve runs when the spell's stack item resolves (after
	// target re-check, before zone routing). Nil means "no effect
	// on resolve" — the card still routes to the battlefield /
	// graveyard per type, but no automation fires. Typical usage
	// for vanilla creatures with no ETB triggers (Birds of Paradise
	// in S14).
	//
	// Returning an error emits an EffectError event and allows
	// resolution to continue — partial failure does not wedge the
	// stack.

	// OnETB fires after a permanent moves from the stack (or
	// battlefield source) into the battlefield. S14 direct-call

	// per-card changes. Nil is common (most catalog cards have no

	// StartingLoyalty is the loyalty counter count a planeswalker
	// enters the battlefield with. 0 means "not a planeswalker" or
	// "planeswalker with 0 starting loyalty" (which the SBA would
	// immediately kill — never the real case). The resolution path
	// stamps this via AddCounter when the card crosses into the
	// battlefield. Used by The Wandering Emperor in S14.

	// TargetMode tells the client what to prompt for at cast time.
	// Serialized to CardView.target_mode so the Svelte cast flow

	//   ""             no prompt (Pyroclasm, Wrath, vanilla permanents)
	//   "any"          player / creature / planeswalker / battle

	//   "stack_spell"  an item currently on the stack (Counterspell,

	// commander-identity-restricted variant. Mana abilities do NOT

	// activate_mana_ability action fires. The Index a client sends in
	// the action payload is the position in this slice.
	//
	// Empty / nil for cards that have no mana abilities (the vast

// pipe (`|`) inside a single brace pair to mean "controller picks
// one of these colors" — Birds of Paradise prints `"{W|U|B|R|G}"`.
