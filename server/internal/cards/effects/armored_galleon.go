// Armored Galleon — Creature — Human Pirate {4}{U}, 5/4:
//
//	"This creature can't attack unless defending player controls an
//	 Island."
//
// The restriction is ADR 0107 §2's (#1879, CR 508.1c). The defending
// player is worked out per target (CR 508.5, 508.5a), so in Commander this
// may attack any opponent who controls an Island, that opponent's
// planeswalkers and the battles they protect, and no one else. The card
// shows whom it can't attack and why.
//
// No simplification.
